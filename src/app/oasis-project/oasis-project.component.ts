    "HowBusyIsMarino.com was created by myself and three fellow Northeastern students to display the historical " +
    "capacity levels of the Marino Center and SquashBusters campus gyms.",
    "With one semester to complete our project and no prior web development experience, we successfully created a " +
    "fully-functioning website (unfortunately no longer hosted online).",
    "First, we worked through automating web scraping on Northeasternâ€™s current gym capacity webpage and storing " +
    "that data using an AWS server.",
    "Once we collected and formatted our data, I learned how to fetch, filter, and plot it onto a heat map using " +
    "JavaScript along with Plotly.js.",
    "We used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the visual design of our site."
